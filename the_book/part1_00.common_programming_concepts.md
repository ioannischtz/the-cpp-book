# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in C++. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to C++,
but we'll discuss them in the context of C++ and explain the conventions around
these concepts.

Specifically, you'll learn about variables, basic types, functions, and control
flow. These foundations will be in every C++ program, and learning them early
will give you a strog core to start from.

## Keywords

The C++ language has a set of _keywords_ that are reserved for use by the
language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use
these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and you'll be using them to do various tasks in your C++
programs; You can find a list of the keywords in
[cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword).
