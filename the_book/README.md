contents above. Each chapter provides detailed explanations and practical
examples to help you grasp the concepts effectively.

## Inspired By

This book is inspired by the structure and style of
["The Rust Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), a popular resource for
learning the Rust programming language, as well as
["A Tour of C++"](https://isocpp.org/tour), an introductory book about C++ by
Bjarne Stroustrup. In fact, "The C++ Programming Book" aims to be a port of "The
Rust Book" to the C++ programming language, providing a similar learning
experience tailored to C++ developers.
